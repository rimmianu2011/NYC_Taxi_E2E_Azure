# Real-Time NYC Taxi Data Analytics Pipeline

A complete data engineering pipeline using **Azure Data Factory**, **Databricks**, and **Azure Data Lake**, designed to process and analyze **NYC Taxi Trip Data** in both batch and streaming modes using the **Medallion Architecture**.

## Overview

This project showcases a scalable and modular data pipeline built on Azure services, enabling real-time insights into NYC taxi activity. The architecture is organized into **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers following the Medallion pattern for data reliability, quality, and performance.

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Azure Data Factory — Bronze Layer
- Ingests raw NYC Taxi data from HTTP source.
- Stores it in **Azure Data Lake Gen2** as csv and parquet format.
- Scheduled with ADF triggers (hourly ingestion).

### 2. Azure Databricks — Silver & Gold Layers
- **Silver Layer**:
  - Cleans and enriches raw data (e.g., null removal, data types).
- **Gold Layer**:
  - Aggregates key metrics and KPIs.
  - Utilizes **Delta Lake** for ACID transactions and versioning.

### 3. Gold-Level KPIs
- Trips per borough
- Average fare per hour
- Total revenue per day

---

## Visualization Dashboard

- Built using **Power BI** connected directly to Gold Delta Tables.
- Features include:
  - Pickup heatmap by zone
  - Borough-wise revenue breakdown
  - Time-series fare analysis
